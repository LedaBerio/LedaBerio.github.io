I am a researcher in Philosophy based in Germany. I am interested in Language and Cognition; in particular, in how acquiring language shapes our cognitive tools to navigate the social world. I am also interested in modeling conversation and in how partecipants do a good-enough job at understanding each other. Finally, I am an intersectional feminist with theoretical and practical interests in feminist theory.

I write and translate (with many others) on and for Abbatto i Muri, an Italian intersectional feminist blog. You can find the blog here <a href="https://abbattoimuri.wordpress.com"> https://abbattoimuri.wordpress.com </a>.<br>

I have written in Italian on the media attacks to Greta Thunberg and how they are guided by a misogynist logic. You can find my article <a href="https://jacobinitalia.it/perche-odiano-greta-thunberg/"> here </a>.

I recommend the following websites and pages for information and feminist education: <br>
<ul> 
<li>  <a href=https://feministkilljoys.com> Feminist Killjoys </a> is the blog by Sara Ahmed, independent feminist scholar </li>
  
<li> <a href= https://linguistici.noblogs.org> Linguistici </a>  is a blog about language and feminist issues, written in Italian by linguistic scholars </li>
  
<li> <a href= https://afrofeminas.com> Afrofeminas </a> is an online magazine on black feminism (Spanish) </li>
  
<li> <a href= https://www.facebook.com/FeminismAndDecolonisation> Feminism and Decolonisation </a>  is a very educational page on decolonisation and feminist issues </li>
   
 </ul>

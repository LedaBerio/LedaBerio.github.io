I write and translate on Abbatto i Muri, an Italian intersectional feminist blog. You can find the blog here <a href="https://abbattoimuri.wordpress.com"> https://abbattoimuri.wordpress.com </a>.<br>


I recommend the following websites and pages for information and feminist education: <br>
<ul> <li> 
https://feministkilljoys.com This is the blog by Sara Ahmed, independent feminist scholar
  
https://linguistici.noblogs.org This is a blog about language and femist issues, written in Italian by linguistic scholars
  
https://afrofeminas.com An online magazine on black feminism (Spanish)
  
https://www.facebook.com/FeminismAndDecolonisation/ This is a very educational page on decolonisation and feminist issues
</li> </ul>
